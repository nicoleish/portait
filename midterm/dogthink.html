  <h2>Do Dog's Think? 🐶 💭</h2>
  <h3>Dogs DO think! </h3>
  <p> According to Dr. Jill Sackman, a clinician in behavioral medicine and senior medical director of BluePearl Veterinary Partners’ Michigan hospitals,  “They probably have the level of cognition of a three to five-year-old human.”
<p>Dogs can distinguish when humans are trying to show them something when they point at an object. They respond to familiar voices and are great at determining whether someone is a friend or foe. </p>
<p> Dogs are smarter than you might think. Many dog owners have said their dog is actually the one that has trained to be fed and let out at the same time every day. They’re capable of making associations and reacting to stimuli. But what they think about, and how they interpret the information, is still a mystery to professionals
