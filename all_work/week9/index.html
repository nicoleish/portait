		<h1> Web 2.0 > Web1.0 and web SQUARED<h1>
		<p> What I understand about Web 2.0 is that the web isn't a baby anymore. She has matured to a beautiful web of platforms and constant usage, an ever updating hub of information, entertainment, and whatever a person's heart desires! </p>
		<h3> after that tiny paragraph, click which web you prefer :) </h3>
		<button id="button1"> Web 2.0 </button>
		<button id="button2" onmouseover="onn (this)"> Web 1.0 </button>

		<p> CSS and JavaScript is the makeup that our baby, the internet, uses to make sites dynamic and <em> pretyyyy </em>. this has helped User Experence grow as it's own field (which is great becuase this is what i wanna do !) other than makeup, our baby has accessories. web 2.0 is able to use cameras, sensors, and feedback loops which can be used so so many thing. possiblities are endless. these accessories has made our baby into a wild teenager who is growing smarter everyday! i've done a project on the internet of tings. when i did it my junior year of high school, i thought it was super cool, and it really still is but now because it is so normal in our daily lives, there feels like there's no way of going back </p>
