  <h2>Can Dogs Understand Humans?🐶🚶‍</h2>
  <h3>the answer is: kinda !</h3>
	<p> One of the theories explaining why dog and human brains have so many similarities is that we evolved together. </p>
	<p>Dogs are the oldest domesticated species. They’ve been interacting with people for millennia, and as a result, have learned how to understand and communicate with humans better than any other species. </p>
	<p>Their strong sense of observation allows them to pick up hints in our body language, smells and the tones of our voices.</p>
	
	<p>“I think people react to those types of signals on a subconscious level, but dogs react to them on a conscious level,” says Dr. JP McCue, a board-certified veterinary neurologist at NYC's Animal Medical Center</p>

<p>“One possible story goes something like this. Dogs followed us into our first cities and camps to take advantage of the food waiting for them in our early garbage piles. Those that were less fearful of humans were rewarded with more food. And those that could pick up on human signals—like pointing, and being told to stay and sit—were given even more. Dogs returned the favor by helping early humans with hunting and protecting them from other wild animals.” </p>
<p> <em> Some studies even believe humans have been able to evolve and survive because of our partnerships with dogs </em> 😮 </p>
