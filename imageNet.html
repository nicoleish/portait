	<h3>imageNet roulette? <em> is that how you spell it?</em> </h3>
	<h4><em> a response from nicole</em></h4>
		
	<p> ImageNet Roulette was as successful as art with an agenda can get. AI is still a strange new concept as the world advances every second of every day and although AI is being used in various applications used every day like internet companies (Facebook), police departments and other government agencies.  </p>

	<p>  From a previous class, I learned about the bias that comes from facial recognition. It makes sense why this is happening, which the article also clearly states; the AI is giving bias answers because the information it is fed it bias because people are biased. Who are the ones working on these projects? Is there diversity in the teams of people creating these technologies? How is a system made for everyone be created by a portion of what society looks like? </p>
	
	<p> This is why diversity is important when it comes to advancing not only technology but innovation for the future.</p>
